## minigames
Some minigames I wrote to test some libraries and stuff. \
feel free to play/look at the implementation. :)

# snake
dependencies: sdl2, sdl2_image libraries. \
Really simple snake game I made to see if I would be able to do it lol. \
made some basic textures in gimp just to have anything :D \
to play, just install the sdl libraries through your package manager (pacman or apt or whatever), go into the snake directory and run "make". That should do it. \
usage: ./snake-game
